## Key Features Implementation

### Authentication
- Role-based authentication and routing
- Protected routes with role checks
- localStorage-based session management

### State Management
- Zustand stores for auth, properties, appointments, reviews, and notifications
- Centralized state with persistence to localStorage

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Adaptive navigation (sidebar for desktop, bottom nav for mobile)
- Responsive grids and layouts

### Business Logic
- Agent approval workflow (pending → active/rejected)
- Property approval workflow (pending → active/rejected)
- Appointment lifecycle (pending → confirmed → completed/cancelled)
- Review system (only after completed appointments)
- Automatic notifications for key actions

## Demo Data

The application includes 6 pre-configured properties:
1. Modern Downtown Condo - Manila - ₱12M
2. Luxury Beach House - Boracay - ₱35M

## Development

This is a prototype application using localStorage for data persistence. In a production environment, you would:

- Implement proper backend API
- Add authentication with JWT/sessions
- Use a real database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Add proper security measures
- Implement email notifications
- Add file upload for property images
- Add payment integration
- Implement real-time notifications
